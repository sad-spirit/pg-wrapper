Executing queries
=================

There are three ways to execute a query:

- ``Connection::execute()`` passing SQL string (this uses
  `pg_query() <https://php.net/manual/en/function.pg-query.php>`__ internally);
- ``Connection::executeParams()`` passing SQL string containing placeholders (``$1``, ``$2``, ...) and separate
  parameter values (this uses
  `pg_query_params() <https://php.net/manual/en/function.pg-query-params.php>`__ internally);
- ``Connection::prepare()`` passing SQL string (usually) containing placeholders to create an instance of
  ``PreparedStatement``, then call ``PreparedStatement::execute()`` / ``PreparedStatement::executeParams()``
  providing separate parameter values (this uses `pg_prepare() <http://php.net/manual/en/function.pg-prepare.php>`__
  and `pg_execute() <http://php.net/manual/en/function.pg-execute.php>`__ internally)

All of the above methods return an instance of ``Result``.

Passing query parameters
========================

While it is possible to embed query parameters directly into SQL string

.. code-block:: php

   $sql = 'select * from articles where article_title ~ ' . $connection->quote($titleFilter)
          . ' or article_author = ' . $connection->quote($authorId);
   $res = $connection->execute($sql);

this approach may lead to security issues if ``quote()`` is not applied thoroughly.
It is only recommended to use ``Connection::execute()`` for queries that do not have parameters.

On the other hand using ``prepare()`` / ``execute()`` workflow has an obvious
performance issue with single queries: it requires two round-trips to the database instead of one.

So ``prepare()`` / ``execute()`` are best used for queries that are executed multiple times with different parameters,
especially for complex ones where time spent on parsing / planning stage is substantial.

If a query contains parameters *and* will be executed only once the best approach is ``executeParams()``:

.. code-block:: php

   $res = $connection->executeParams(
       'select * from articles where article_title ~ $1 or article_author = $2',
       [$titleFilter, $authorId]
   );

This gives the benefits of previous approaches without their shortcomings:

- Parameters are passed separately from query, this makes SQL injection far less likely;
- Only one database round-trip is required.


Specifying parameter types
==========================

``Connection::executeParams()`` also accepts type specifications for parameters:

.. code-block:: php

   $result = $connection->executeParams(
       'select * from articles where article_id = any($1::integer[])',
       [[1, 2, 3]],
       ['integer[]']
   );

``PreparedStatement`` will try to get proper parameter types from Postgres by default, but
these can be overridden / specified manually via ``Connection::prepare()``, ``PreparedStatement::setParameterType()``,
``PreparedStatement::bindValue()``, and ``PreparedStatement::bindParam()``.

.. code-block:: php

   $prepared = $connection->prepare(
       'select * from articles where article_id = any($1::integer[])'
   );
   $prepared->bindValue(1, [4, 5, 6], new ArrayConverter(new IntegerConverter()));

These type specifications are processed by an implementation of ``TypeConverterFactory`` set for ``Connection`` via
``setTypeConverterFactory()`` method. The :ref:`default implementation <converter-factories-default>`
will accept either of the following:

- :ref:`Type name as string <converter-factories-names>`. As shown above, array types can be specified using
  square brackets: ``typename[]``.
- Composite type specification as an array ``'column' => 'column type specification'``.
- ``TypeConverter`` instance, it will receive current ``Connection`` to update its configuration, if needed.

It is not necessary to provide type information for *every* parameter: some may be skipped or type info omitted
altogether. In this case an attempt will be made to guess which converter to use based on PHP
variable type.

.. tip::
    You *must* specify the type if the parameter is a PHP array as in above examples, guessing will definitely fail.
    If the parameter is a scalar or :ref:`an instance of a known class <converter-factories-classes>`
    then guessing will probably work.

.. _queries-result:

Specifying result column types
==============================

Generally you don't need to specify types for columns in query result: these are deduced from result metadata.

One notable exception is a column defined by a row type constructor:

.. code-block:: php

   $composite = $conn->execute("select ROW('fuzzy dice', 42, 1.99) as needstype");
   var_dump($composite[0]['needstype']);

the above will output

.. code-block:: output

   string(22) "("fuzzy dice",42,1.99)"

as Postgres specifies its type as a generic ``record`` pseudo-type. To provide necessary type information
for a ``Result`` you can either pass it to ``execute()`` / ``executeParams()``:

.. code-block:: php

   $composite = $conn->execute(
       "select ROW('fuzzy dice', 42, 1.99) as needstype",
       [['text', 'int4', 'float8']]
   );
   var_dump($composite[0]['needstype']);

or call ``setType()`` on the ``Result`` instance:

.. code-block:: php

   $composite = $conn->execute("select ROW('fuzzy dice', 42, 1.99) as needstype");
   $composite->setType('needstype', ['text', 'int4', 'float8']);
   var_dump($composite[0]['needstype']);

both of the above will output

.. code-block:: output

   array(3) {
     [0] =>
     string(10) "fuzzy dice" 
     [1] =>
     int(42)
     [2] =>
     double(1.99)
   }

Query-related methods of ``Connection``
=======================================

The methods for query execution were mostly covered above

``public function execute(string $sql, array $resultTypes = []): Result``
    Executes a given query. ``$resultTypes`` information is passed to ``Result`` and overrides automatically
    determined types.

``public function executeParams(string $sql, array $params, array $paramTypes = [], array $resultTypes = []): Result``
    Executes a given query with the ability to pass parameters separately. The query should contain positional
    placeholders ``$1``, ``$2``, â€¦ that will be replaced by ``$params`` on execution.

    ``$paramTypes`` specify the types for query parameters, ``$resultTypes`` information will be passed to ``Result``.

``public function prepare(string $query, array $paramTypes = [], array $resultTypes = []): PreparedStatement``
    Prepares a given query for execution, returning a ``PreparedStatement`` object. As with ``executeParams()``,
    the query will usually contain positional placeholders.

    ``$paramTypes`` specify types for parameters, ``$resultTypes`` will (eventually) be passed to ``Result``.

Methods that help with embedding stuff directly in SQL are also available, but their use is discouraged:

``public function quote(mixed $value, mixed $type = null): string``
    Quotes a value for inclusion in a query, taking connection encoding into account.
    This is only needed when building a query by hand:

    .. code-block:: php

        $sql .= 'WHERE foo = ' . $connection->quote($foo);

    It is recommended to pass parameters separately from query instead.

``public function quoteIdentifier(string $identifier): string``
    Quotes an identifier (e.g. table or column name) for inclusion in a query.
    It is a bad idea to take ``$identifier`` from user input even if using this method.


.. _queries-prepared:

``PreparedStatement`` API
=========================

.. note::
    Instances of this class are created by ``Connection::prepare()`` method, ``PreparedStatement::__construct()``
    is marked internal and should not be used outside of ``Connection`` methods.

The statement is automatically prepared when an instance of ``PreparedStatement`` is created and automatically
deallocated when the object is destroyed. Manual methods are also available just in case:

``public function prepare(): $this``
    Actually prepares the statement with `pg_prepare() <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pg-prepare.php>`__.

``public function deallocate(): $this``
    Manually deallocates the prepared statement using ``DEALLOCATE ...`` SQL statement.

    Trying to call ``execute()`` / ``executeParams()`` after ``deallocate()`` will result in an ``Exception``.

A very useful method allows specifying the number of parameters in the query:

``public function setNumberOfParameters(int $numberOfParameters): $this``
    Sets number of parameters used in the query.

    Parameter symbols should start with ``$1`` and have no gaps in numbers, otherwise Postgres will throw an error,
    so setting their number is sufficient.

.. code-block:: php

    // If we know the number of parameters...
    $prepared->setNumberOfParameters(2);
    // ...then all the below methods will throw exceptions
    $prepared->executeParams([1, 2, 3]);
    $prepared->bindValue(4, 'foo');
    $prepared->setParameterType(5, 'integer');

.. tip::
    Number of parameters will always be set to a correct value by ``fetchParameterTypes()``, so
    there is no need to call ``setNumberOfParameters()`` unless automatic fetching of parameter types is disabled.

Two ways to supply parameters
-----------------------------

There are two ways to supply parameters for a prepared statement, the first one is binding the parameters and
calling ``execute()``

``public function bindValue(int $parameterNumber, mixed $value, mixed $type = null): $this``
    Sets the value for a parameter of a prepared query.

    ``$parameterNumber`` is 1-based, ``$type`` contains specification of parameter type. An exception will be raised
    if ``$type`` is omitted / ``null`` and the parameter type is not already known.

``public function bindParam(int $parameterNumber, mixed &$param, mixed $type = null): $this``
    Binds a variable to a parameter of a prepared query.

``public function execute(): Result``
    Executes a prepared query using previously bound values. Note that the method does not accept arguments, all
    values should be bound.

.. code-block:: php

    $prepared = $connection->prepare('select * from foo where bar_id = $1 and foo_deleted = $2');
    $result   = $prepared
        ->bindValue(1, 10)
        ->bindValue(2, false)
        ->execute();

The second way is just

``public function executeParams(array $params): Result``
    Executes the prepared query using (only) the given parameters.

    ``$params`` should have integer keys with (0-based) key ``N`` corresponding to (1-based) statement placeholder
    ``$(N + 1)``. Unlike native `pg_execute() <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pg-execute.php>`__, array keys
    will be respected and values mapped by keys rather than in "array order": passing ``['foo', 'bar']`` will use
    'foo' for ``$1`` and 'bar' for ``$2``, while ``[1 => 'foo', 0 => 'bar']`` will use
    'bar' for ``$1`` and 'foo' for ``$2``.

.. code-block:: php

    $prepared = $connection->prepare('select * from foo where bar_id = $1 and foo_deleted = $2');
    $result   = $prepared->executeParams([10, false]);


.. note::
    These approaches are mutually exclusive, ``executeParams()`` will throw an exception if any parameter
    has a bound value.

Fetching parameter types automatically
--------------------------------------

By default, ``PreparedStatement`` gets the types of the query parameters from Postgres (specifically, from
``pg_prepared_statements`` system view), so there is no need to pass type specifications at all:

.. code-block:: php

    $prepared = $connection->prepare(
        'select * from pg_catalog.pg_type where oid = any($1) order by typname'
    );
    $result   = $prepared->executeParams([[16, 20, 603]]);

This behaviour is controlled by static methods

``public static function setAutoFetchParameterTypes(bool $autoFetch): void``
    Sets whether parameter types should be automatically fetched after first preparing a statement.

``public static function getAutoFetchParameterTypes(): bool``
    Returns whether parameter types will be automatically fetched after first preparing a statement.
    This defaults to ``true`` since version 3.0

Changing that setting will affect all ``PreparedStatement`` objects created afterwards.

The method that fetches types can also be called manually

``public function fetchParameterTypes(bool $overrideExistingTypes = false): $this``
    Fetches info about the types assigned to query parameters from the database.

    This method will always set parameter count to a correct value, but will not change existing type converters
    for parameters unless ``$overrideExistingTypes`` is ``true``.

Specifying types manually
-------------------------

It is assumed that the statement will be executed multiple times and that types of parameters and result columns
are quite unlikely to change between executions. Therefore, both query execution methods do not accept
type specifications and ``executeParams()`` will throw an exception if a type for a parameter is not known.

Both parameter types and result types can be specified either when preparing a statement

.. code-block:: php

    $prepared = $connection->prepare(
        'select row(foo_id, foo_added) from foo where bar = any($1::integer[])',
        ['integer[]'],
        [['id' => 'integer', 'added' => 'timestamptz']]
    );

or using the methods of ``PreparedStatement`` instance

``public function setParameterType(int $parameterNumber, mixed $type): $this``
    Sets the type for a parameter of a prepared query.

``public function setResultTypes(array $resultTypes): $this``
    Sets result types that will be passed to created ``Result`` instances.

Additionally, ``bindValue()`` and ``bindParam()`` accept type specifications as well.
