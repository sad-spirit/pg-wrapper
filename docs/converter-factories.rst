Type converter factories
========================

Factories are used to create type converters for the result fields using metadata provided by
`pg_field_type_oid() <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pg-field-type-oid.php>`__
and to simplify passing type information to query execution methods. Consider passing type specifications

.. code-block:: php

    $result = $connection->executeParams(
        'select row(foo_id, foo_added) from foo where bar = any($1::integer[])',
        [[1, 2, 3]],
        ['integer[]'],
        [['id' => 'integer', 'added' => 'timestamptz']]
    );

vs creating converters manually

.. code-block:: php

    $result = $connection->executeParams(
        'select * from foo where bar = any($1::integer[])',
        [[1, 2, 3]],
        [new ArrayConverter(new IntegerConverter())],
        [new CompositeConverter(['id' => new IntegerConverter(), 'added' => new TimeStampTzConverter()])]
    );

In the "wrapper" part of the package factory methods are called by ``Connection`` and ``PreparedStatement`` classes
when converting query parameters and by ``Result`` when converting query results.
The only methods that will be called directly are those used to set up
:ref:`custom types conversion <converter-factories-setup>`,
most probably for :ref:`enum types <converter-factories-enum>` and the like.

Common interfaces
=================

``TypeConverterFactory``
------------------------

All classes that create type converters implement the following interface

.. code-block:: php

    namespace sad_spirit\pg_wrapper;

    use sad_spirit\pg_wrapper\converters\ConnectionAware;

    interface TypeConverterFactory extends ConnectionAware
    {
        public function getConverterForTypeSpecification(mixed $type): TypeConverter;
        public function getConverterForTypeOID(int|string $oid): TypeConverter;
        public function getConverterForPHPValue(mixed $value): TypeConverter;
    }

``getConverterForTypeSpecification()``
    This method returns a converter based on manually provided type specification (commonly,
    :ref:`a type name <converter-factories-names>`).
    It should throw an exception if a matching converter cannot be found as this is most probably an user error.

    Values accepted as specification are implementation-specific. Any implementation should, however, accept
    an instance of ``TypeConverter`` and update it with the ``Connection`` instance
    if it implements ``ConnectionAware``.

``getConverterForTypeOID()``
    Returns a converter for the type with the given OID. It expects an OID (internal Postgres object identifier)
    that is a primary key for some row of system ``pg_type`` table.

    The method is mainly used by ``Result`` to find converters for returned columns. It should not throw an exception
    if a converter is not found, usually returning an instance of ``StubConverter`` in that case.

``getConverterForPHPValue()``
    Tries to return a converter based on type/class of its argument.

    This is used by query execution methods if type specification was not given for a query parameter. It should
    throw an exception if the argument type is ambiguous (e.g. PHP array) or its class is not known.

As the interface extends ``ConnectionAware`` it is possible to specify the ``Connection`` this factory works with.
Usually the factory will be able to perform *some* conversions without ``Connection`` specified, but definitely
not those of the custom database types.

The package contains two implementations of ``TypeConverterFactory``: ``converters\DefaultTypeConverterFactory``
and ``converters\StubTypeConverterFactory``

``TypeOIDMapperAware``
----------------------

This interface should be implemented by classes that use an instance of ``TypeOIDMapper``:

.. code-block:: php

    namespace sad_spirit\pg_wrapper\converters;

    interface TypeOIDMapperAware
    {
        public function setOIDMapper(TypeOIDMapper $mapper): void;
        public function getOIDMapper(): TypeOIDMapper;
    }

An implementation of ``TypeOIDMapper`` is used, as its name implies, to map type OIDs to type names and is required
mostly for ``getConverterForTypeOID()`` method.

.. _converter-factories-setup:

``ConfigurableTypeConverterFactory``
------------------------------------

This interface was introduced in release 3.1 to be used in type hints instead of ``DefaultTypeConverterFactory``.
It defines additional methods to register new type converters and type classes with the factory

.. code-block:: php

    namespace sad_spirit\pg_wrapper\converters;

    use sad_spirit\pg_wrapper\TypeConverter;
    use sad_spirit\pg_wrapper\TypeConverterFactory;

    interface ConfigurableTypeConverterFactory extends TypeConverterFactory, TypeOIDMapperAware
    {
        public function registerConverter(
            callable|TypeConverter|class-string<TypeConverter> $converter,
            string[]|string $type,
            string $schema = 'pg_catalog'
        ): void;
        public function registerClassMapping(class-string $className, string $type, string $schema = 'pg_catalog'): void;
        public function getConverterForQualifiedName(string $typeName, ?string $schemaName = null): TypeConverter;
    }

``registerConverter()``
    Registers a converter for a named type. When a converter is requested for the given type name via
    ``getConverterForQualifiedName()``, ``$converter`` will be used to create the return value.

    ``$converter`` can be either of

     * ``TypeConverter`` instance, a clone of that will be returned by ``getConverterForQualifiedName()``;
     * a callable returning an instance of ``TypeConverter``;
     * Name of the class implementing ``TypeConverter``.

``registerClassMapping()``
    Registers a mapping between PHP class and database type name. When an instance of the given class will be provided
    to ``getConverterForPHPValue()`` a converter for the given database type will be returned.

``getConverterForQualifiedName()``
    Returns type converter for separately supplied type and schema names. If a converter for a base type is requested,
    and it was not registered via ``registerConverter()``, an exception will be thrown.

    This method was previously marked as ``@internal`` but now can be considered a part of the API.

Note that it is only needed to register converters for base types, proper converters for arrays / composites / ranges
over these base types will be built automatically:

.. code-block:: php

   $factory->registerConverter(BlahConverter::class, 'blah', 'blah');
   $factory->getConverter('blah.blah[]');

will return

.. code-block:: php

   new ArrayConverter(new BlahConverter());

Factory implementations
=======================

``StubTypeConverterFactory``
----------------------------

``getConverterForTypeOID()`` and ``getConverterForPHPValue()`` methods of this class return
an instance of ``converters\StubConverter``.

Its ``getConverterForTypeSpecification()`` method also returns ``converters\StubConverter`` if passed anything except
an implementation of ``TypeConverter`` as a ``$type`` argument. Otherwise it will return ``$type``,
configured with current ``Connection`` if it implements ``ConnectionAware``.

.. tip::
    This class can be used to effectively disable type conversion, making package behave like stock ``pgsql`` extension.

.. _converter-factories-default:

``DefaultTypeConverterFactory``
-------------------------------

This is an implementation of ``ConfigurableTypeConverterFactory`` interface. Its instance is automatically added
to a ``Connection`` object unless ``setTypeConverterFactory()`` is explicitly used.

``getConverterForTypeSpecification()`` method accepts the following as its ``$type`` argument:

- Type name as a string. A minimal parser is implemented, so schema-qualified names like ``pg_catalog.int4``,
  double-quoted identifiers like ``"CamelCaseType"``, SQL standard names like ``CHARACTER VARYING`` will be understood.

  Array types can be specified with square brackets as ``typename[]``.

  :ref:`The next chapter <converter-factories-names>` lists all type names that are supported by default.

- ``TypeConverter`` instance. Its properties will be updated from current ``Connection`` object if needed
  (e.g. date and time converters will use ``DateStyle`` setting of connected database).
- Composite type specification as an array
  ``'column' => 'column type specification'``
